    <h1>Hi! This is <b>Mithila</b> </h1>
   
    <p1>I am a student.I look forward to being in your class because I am always <mark>enthusiastic</mark> about learning more and curious about what your class has to offer.I am a dedicated student who enjoys challenges.</p>
    <p2>One of my <mark>strengths</mark> is curiosity and hard work. However, I would say one of my weaknesses is public speaking. Nevertheless, I am working towards transforming this weakness into a strength, by staying more organized, practicing, and focusing on myself rather than the public. I believe I will overcome this in no time.</p>
        <p3>I am excited to be here with you and canâ€™t wait for us to learn together</p>
            <p4>Thats all about me. thnak you</p>
